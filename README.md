# Reviving-Grayscale-A-Seed-Point-Propagation-Approach-to-Image-Colorization
Proposed novel method for grayscale image colorization: a combination of neural networks and optimization techniques. Superpixel segmentation, feature extraction, and guided image filtering improve accuracy without user input on scene semantics during training.
